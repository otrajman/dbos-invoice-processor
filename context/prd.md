# AI-Powered Invoice Processing Application - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement

Manual invoice processing is a significant pain point for finance teams across organizations, creating multiple challenges:

- **Time-Intensive Data Entry**: Finance clerks spend hours manually extracting data from invoices, leading to processing delays and reduced productivity
- **Human Error Risk**: Manual data entry introduces errors in vendor information, amounts, dates, and line items, causing payment delays and vendor relationship issues
- **Inconsistent Processing Times**: Manual workflows create unpredictable processing times, making cash flow planning difficult
- **Lack of Visibility**: Limited real-time visibility into invoice status creates bottlenecks and makes it difficult to track approval workflows
- **Duplicate Payment Risk**: Without automated duplicate detection, organizations risk paying the same invoice multiple times
- **Compliance Challenges**: Manual processes make it difficult to maintain audit trails and ensure consistent approval workflows

### Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
- Reduce invoice processing time by 75% (from average 5 days to 1.25 days)
- Achieve 95% data extraction accuracy through AI-powered processing
- Eliminate duplicate payments through automated detection
- Provide real-time visibility into invoice status and approval workflows
- Reduce manual data entry by 80% for successfully processed invoices

**Success Metrics:**
- Processing time: Target <2 days from upload to approval
- Data accuracy: >95% accuracy on extracted fields
- User adoption: 100% of finance team using the system within 3 months
